# ds_module_6_python_api_challenge
Utilizing Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Part 1 WeatherPy requierd creating a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator usinf OpenWeatherMapAPI. Then creating a series of scatter plots showing these relationships:
    Latitude vs. Temperature,

    Latitude vs. Humidity,

    Latitude vs. Cloudiness,

    Latitude vs. Wind Speed,

    Then a series of linear regressions showing these relationships:

    Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude,

    Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude,

    Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude,

    Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude,

    Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude,

    Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude,

    Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude,

    Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude,

    and describing any relationships shown by the data.

Part 2 VacationPy used Geoapify API and the data from Part 1 to create map visualizations. The map showed the humidity in each of the cities from part one. Then, I narrowed the DataFrame down to find my personal ideal weather conditions, built a second DataFrame to find the nearest hotels to the cities in the narrowed DataFrame, and added the hotel information to each plotted city.

Part 1 My tutor helped me understand the building of the API url by taking me through the documentation.
My coding and plots were checked and compaired to examples by my TA.
